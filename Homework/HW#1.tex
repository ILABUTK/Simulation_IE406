%\begin{enumerate}

%\item 
\textcolor{orange}{\bf 1:}  Prepare a list of software packages for ``Modeling and/or Simulation'' and address the following:
a). The features of the packages; b). The limitations of the packages. Feel free to use your favorite search engines and refer to
Winter Simulation Conference proceedings, IIE Magazine, and OR/MS Magazine. 

\vskip 0.3in

%\item 
\textcolor{orange}{\bf 2:}  Conduct a literature review on the application of modeling \& simulation to one or more research areas of your interest, 
e.g. ``supply chain management'', ``homeland security'', ``transportation'', ``healthcare'', and so on. Attach 5 to 10 key references that you cite along with your review
when you submit it. 

\vskip 0.3in 


\textcolor{orange}{\bf Requirements:} Scientific writing style. There are many excellent (and not-so-excellent) resources online regarding technical writings, e.g., ``The Science of Scientific Writing'' \url{https://www.e-education.psu.edu/styleforstudents/c10_p6.html}).
\vskip 0.2in

\textcolor{orange}{\bf Submission Guideline:} 1) Submit to Canvas. 2) Email your homework to \url{ie526.utk@gmail.com}. When you have multiple files, please zip them
into one single file. 7zip (\url{http://www.7-zip.org/}) is recommended and .7z file extension is suggested. Note that occasionally, UTK email system may filter emails with attachments, especially when attachments are like .zip and/or with executable files. You should receive an email notification if your email goes through. 
\vskip 0.2in
\textcolor{orange}{\bf Naming convention:} Please name your files consistently using names like ``hw1\_yourname.zip''. 
%Also, please submit your homework to a shared Google Drive at \url{https://drive.google.com/a/utk.edu/folderview?id=0B92X26p0Cma-X21KUXFQdWlhdXM&usp=sharing}. Note that you must use your UTK email/password to login into Google Drive to access this folder.  You will see something like``HW\#1'' under the folder. Create a folder like ``Netid\_Your Name'' and upload your unzipped files to that folder.
