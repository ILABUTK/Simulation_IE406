\vskip 0.2in

%\begin{enumerate}
%
%\item 
%\textcolor{orange}{\bf 1:}  Simulation by-hand. Use the provided arrival time of the parts (arrival.txt) and the service times (service.txt) to simulate the operations
%in a manufacturing facility where \textbf{two} identical parallel machines are available. There is a single FIFO queue where parts wait to be processed. Simulate for 10 minutes. Make a table similar to the compact one in the handout \#40. 
%Summarize the Production, Average Waiting Time in Queue, Average Time in System, Time Average of Number of Parts in Queue, and Utilization. (Tip: Excel may be handy here). 
%\vskip 0.3in
%
%\textcolor{orange}{\bf Bonus:} Use a general purpose programming language (C, C++, Java, MatLab, etc.), a.k.a, your own simulation software, to simulate the operations and 
%calculate the Production, Average Waiting Time in Queue, Average Time in System, Time Average of Number of Parts in Queue, and Utilization. 
%
%\vskip 0.3in
%
%\item 
\textcolor{orange}{\bf 1:} Generate 10000 random numbers using the LCM (LCG) method. Feel free to use any programming language or software package. (Tip: R (\emph{Recommened}), Python or Excel may be handy here).
\begin{itemize}
\item Use $X_0$=27, a=17, c=9, and m=10000. 
\item  Plot a histogram of the above random numbers (RN) and comment on the quality of the RNs. 
\item  Use K-S test to test the uniformity of the first 10 RNs. Use Alpha=0.05. 
\item Generate 10000 variates following the exponential distribution with $\lambda$=10 based on the above RNs using inverse-transform. Plot a histogram of these variates.
\item  Use T-test to test the first 20 RNs. $H_0$: $\bar{X}$ = 0.5; $H_1$: $\bar{X} \neq$0.5; $\alpha$=0.01. 
\item {[\texttt{Optional. Bonus.}]} Use $X_0$=0, $a$=6364136223846793005, $c$=1442695040888963407, and m=10000. Generate 10000 random numbers and plot a histogram. 
\end{itemize}

\vskip 0.1in 

\textcolor{orange}{\bf 2:} Estimate the value of $\pi$ using random numbers only.  You may use the numbers that you generated in Question \#1, or you may generate more numbers for higher precision. (\textit{Tip:} you can conduct a Monte Carlo experiment by throwing darts at a board blindfolded. Or find other creative ways.)

\vskip 0.3in 

\textcolor{orange}{\bf Submission Guideline:} Summarize your work in a  report (in Word or PDF format), including charts, output, explanations and source code. Attach your source code. \\
1) Submit to Canvas. \\
2) Email your homework to \url{ie526.utk@gmail.com}. \\
When you have multiple files, please zip them
into one single file. 7zip (\url{http://www.7-zip.org/}) is recommended and .7z file extension is suggested. Note that occasionally, UTK email system may filter emails with attachments, especially when attachments are like .zip and/or with executable files. You should receive an email notification if your email goes through. 
\vskip 0.2in
%Also, please submit your homework to a shared Google Drive at \url{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B92X26p0Cma-YmxjWFNqdk9HNnc?usp=sharing}. Note that you must use your UTK email/password to login into Google Drive to access this folder.  You will see something like``HW\#2'' under the folder. Create a folder like ``Netid\_Your Name'' and upload your unzipped files to that folder. You feel free to change the permission such that no one but the TA and Dr. Li can access that folder.



% 
%This course focuses on the construction of simulation models of real or
%  conceptual systems using the simulation software package \textbf{AnyLogic} 
%  while covering the analytical aspects of utilization of simulation models
%   and optimization techniques. Both \textbf{discrete event models} and \textbf{agent-based 
%   models} will be covered. \textbf{System dynamics models} will be briefly introduced.
%   
%\item \textcolor{orange}{\bf VALUE PROPOSITION:} Simulation is a powerful tool
%to analyze complex, dynamic and stochastic systems.  Ability to design, analyze, and
%interpret simulation models for such systems is crucial in making efficient business and
%  engineering decisions. This course will address the topics that are
%  essential for developing such skills. 
%
%\item \textcolor{orange}{\bf OBJECTIVES:} On completion of this course
% students will be able to correctly \textbf{design, analyze and interpret} the results
%  of computer simulation experiments using simulation software package. Specifically, they will: 
%  \begin{itemize}
%\item In general, be able to build simulation models using a computer software package;
%\item Understand the assumptions, strengths and weaknesses of simulation models;
%\item Analyze and translate problems into a form suitable for applying simulation strategies; and 
%\item Validate simulation models and optimize the system.

%
%\item \textcolor{orange}{\bf COURSE REQUIREMENTS, ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION METHODS:} 
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%
%
%\item Students are responsible for announcements and material covered
%  in class.
%
%
%\item {\bf Homework and Quizzes.} Homework problems will be assigned
%   based on the covered material. Quizzes will be pop quizzes. 
%Assignments are due at the beginning of the class. No late work is accepted. Assignments are individual efforts based unless advised otherwise.  
%  
%
%\item {\bf Exams.} No written exams! Instead, you will be working on a team-based term project (rubrics will be given).
% Mini projects may be given as a take-home exam or a quiz. 
%
%
%\item {\bf Attendance} is not mandatory. However, it is {\bf extremely important} to succeed in this course.
%
%\item {\bf Extra credit. } Each student may receive up to 3 extra credit points towards their final grade during the lecture activities
%  (i.e., class engagement, pop-quiz, grade lottery).  {\bf No extra credit} will be given for
%  any additional work or re-doing assignments.
%
%\item {\bf Grading } will be based on homework assignments (30\%), quizzes (30\%), and term projects (40\%). 
%
%%% To calculate your grade for the class, the following formula
%%%   will be used:
%
%%% $$
%%% G = 0.25 \cdot \frac{G_{Q}}{7} + 0.25\cdot G_{exam1} + 0.25 \cdot G_{exam2} + 0.25 \cdot G_{exam2} 
%%% $$
%
%%%   where $G_{Q}$  is the sum of all points received for the quizzes (0 to 700),
%
%%%  $G_{exam1}$ is the first exam grade, $G_{exam2}$ and $G_{exam3}$ are the second and third exam grades respectively. 
%
%%% \vskip 0.3in
%%%   For example, if you got 550 points out of 700 possible for your
%%%   homework assignments, 87 points on the first exam, 55 points on the
%%%   second exam, and 95 points on the final exam, then you final grade
%%%   will be:
%
%%%   \begin{equation*}
%%%     G = 0.25 * 550/7 + 0.25 * 87 + 0.25 * 55 + 0.25 * 95 = 78.89
%%% \end{equation*}
%
%\item {\bf Grading scale}: A (100-90), B+ (90-86), B(85-80), C+ (80-75), C (75-70), D (70-60), F (60-0)
%%\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}

% 
%%\item Cell phones, loud music and noisy behavior  are not allowed.
%\item {\bf Policy:} When taking a quiz or homework assignment, cheating in any form will result in a grade of 0 for that exam. Plagiarism is defined as ``to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own, to use (another's production) without crediting the source'' and ``to commit literary theft: present as new and original an idea or product derived from an existing source'' as on Merriam-Webster.

%%% the scheduled time, although alternative uses of the scheduled exam period may
%%% be designated by the instructor.
%%% \begin{itemize}
%%% \item Students are not required to take more than two written exams on any
%%% day. The instructor(s) of the last non-departmental exam(s) on that day
%%% must reschedule the student's exam during the exam period. It is the
%%% obligation of students with such conflicts to make appropriate
%%% arrangements with the instructor at least two weeks prior to the end of
%%% classes.
%%% \item All final exams must be given during the final exam period at the
%%% scheduled time, although alternative uses of the scheduled exam period
%%% may be designated by the instructor.
%%% \item No in-class written quizzes or tests counting more than 10 percent of
%%% the semester grade may be given the last five calendar days prior to the
%%% study period.
