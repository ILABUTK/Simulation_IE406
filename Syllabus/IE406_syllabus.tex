\item \textcolor{orange}{\bf COURSE DESCRIPTION:}This course covers  topics 
in modeling and simulation with applications to all areas of \textbf{business} and \textbf{industry} 
where management, strategic and operational decision making can be enhanced
 through the analysis, modeling, simulation, and optimization of complex systems. 
 Particular attention is given to \textit{Supply Chain Logistics and Healthcare Systems}. 
 
This course focuses on the construction of simulation models of real or
  conceptual systems using the simulation software package \textbf{AnyLogic} 
  while covering the analytical aspects of utilization of simulation models
   and optimization techniques. Both discrete event models and agent-based 
   models will be covered.
   
(RE) Prerequisite(s): IE200 or Statistics 251.\\
(RE) Corequisite(s): IE310.

\item \textcolor{orange}{\bf VALUE PROPOSITION:} Simulation is a powerful tool
to analyze complex, dynamic and stochastic systems.  Ability to design, analyze, and
interpret simulation models for such systems is crucial in making efficient business and
  engineering decisions. This course will address the topics that are
  essential for developing these skills.

\item \textcolor{orange}{\bf STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES:} On completion of this course
 students will be able to correctly design, analyze and interpret the results
  of computer simulation experiments using simulation software package. Specifically, they will: 
  \begin{itemize}
\item In general, be able to build simulation models using a computer;
\item Understand the assumptions, strengths and weaknesses of
simulation models;
\item Analyze and translate problems into a form suitable for applying simulation strategies; and 
\item Validate simulation models and optimize the system.
\end{itemize}


\item	\textcolor{orange}{\bf LEARNING ENVIRONMENT:} 

%% [This section provides students with the instructor’s vision of what take place in the class.  It includes information about the methods of instruction, the role of the student, the role of the faculty member, what will take place in class, out of class, the tools for learning, etc. This section provides an opportunity to present the notion of shared responsibility for learning.  A useful table with examples is provided below: 

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
\hline
Students Responsibility & Instructors Responsibility \\
\hline
\hline
 Be prepared for all classes & Be prepared for all classes \\
\hline 
Be respectful of others & Be respectful of the students \\

\item \textcolor{orange}{\bf TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES:} 

 %% [This section includes information about course Blackboard Site, and any type of research / reference materials or technology (i.e., Online@UT, LiveText, or a bibliography) the student will need to use for the classroom.]

All homework assignments and lecture slides will be posted on the course Canvas/Blackboard Site or shared Google Drive folder. 

\item \textcolor{orange}{\bf COURSE REQUIREMENTS, ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION METHODS:} 

\begin{enumerate}


\item Students are responsible for announcements and material covered
  in class.


\item {\bf Homework and Quizzes.} Homework problems will be assigned
   based on the covered material. Quizzes will be pop quizzes. 
Assignments are due at the beginning of the class. No late work is accepted. Assignments are individual efforts based unless advised otherwise.  
  

\item {\bf Exams.} No written exams! Instead, you will be working on a team-based term project (rubrics will be given).
 Mini projects may be given as a take-home exam or a quiz. 


\item {\bf Attendance} is not mandatory, however it is {\bf extremely important} to succeed in this course.

\item {\bf Extra credit. } Each student may receive up to 3 extra
  credit points towards their final grade during the lecture activities
  (i.e., pop-quiz, grade lottery).  {\bf No extra credit} will be given for
  any additional work or redoing assignments.

\item {\bf Grading } will be based on homework assignments (30\%), quizzes (30\%), and term projects (40\%). 

%% To calculate your grade for the class, the following formula
%%   will be used:

%% $$
%% G = 0.25 \cdot \frac{G_{Q}}{7} + 0.25\cdot G_{exam1} + 0.25 \cdot G_{exam2} + 0.25 \cdot G_{exam2} 
%% $$

%%   where $G_{Q}$  is the sum of all points received for the quizzes (0 to 700),

%%  $G_{exam1}$ is the first exam grade, $G_{exam2}$ and $G_{exam3}$ are the second and third exam grades respectively. 

%% \vskip 0.3in
%%   For example, if you got 550 points out of 700 possible for your
%%   homework assignments, 87 points on the first exam, 55 points on the
%%   second exam, and 95 points on the final exam, then you final grade
%%   will be:

%%   \begin{equation*}
%%     G = 0.25 * 550/7 + 0.25 * 87 + 0.25 * 55 + 0.25 * 95 = 78.89
%% \end{equation*}

\item {\bf Grading scale} 
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& &A&100-91&A-&91-89\\
\hline
B+& 89-86 &B& 86-82 &B--& 82-80\\
\hline
C+& 80-77 &C& 77-72 &C--& 72-70\\
\hline
D+&70-67 &D& 67-62 &D--& 52-60\\
\hline 
F & 59-0 & & & & \\
\hline

\end{tabular}
 
%\item Cell phones, loud music and noisy behavior  are not allowed.
\item {\bf When taking a quiz or homework assignment, cheating in any form will result in a grade of 0 for that exam.}
\end{enumerate}

%% [This section includes class attendance and tardiness policy, evaluation methods and grading system, i.e., rubrics, percentages, tests, quizzes, weighting, curve or UT grading distribution, grade appeals to instructor, etc.; it may also include the policy for incompletes and withdrawals.]

%% {\bf Freedom to
%%   Learn.}  The responsibility to secure and to respect general
%%   conditions conducive to the freedom to learn is shared by all
%%   members of the academic community. The university welcomes and
%%   honors people of all races, creeds, cultures, and sexual
%%   orientations, and values intellectual curiosity, pursuit of
%%   knowledge, and academic freedom and integrity.


%% {\bf Final Exam Policy.} Final exams must be given during the final exam period at
%% the scheduled time, although alternative uses of the scheduled exam period may
%% be designated by the instructor.
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item Students are not required to take more than two written exams on any
%% day. The instructor(s) of the last non-departmental exam(s) on that day
%% must reschedule the student's exam during the exam period. It is the
%% obligation of students with such conflicts to make appropriate
%% arrangements with the instructor at least two weeks prior to the end of
%% classes.
%% \item All final exams must be given during the final exam period at the
%% scheduled time, although alternative uses of the scheduled exam period
%% may be designated by the instructor.
%% \item No in-class written quizzes or tests counting more than 10 percent of
%% the semester grade may be given the last five calendar days prior to the
%% study period.
%% \end{itemize}
